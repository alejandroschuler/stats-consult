Consulting is a core ability necessary for success in both academia and industry that we explicitly emphasize in our training program. While student expertise may sometimes not be sufficient to fully resolve the problems raised by collaborators, it is precisely the process of encountering these new problems or of translating unfamiliar scenarios to formal statistical terms that cultivates growth and statistical maturity. \n\nSimultaneously, this course aims to provide a free quantitative consulting service accessible to the BPH community, e.g. MPH students working on their capstone projects.\n\n# Structure\n\nThe course consists of one hour a week of “lecture” and two hours a week of consulting time (starting after week 2). \n\n## Lecture\n\nIn the first few weeks of the course we will use our joint meeting time for some expository lectures on how to approach statistical consultation. After this our meeting times will be used for guest lectures so you can see how consulting is done in the real world (industry and academia) and for student presentations. You are each expected to give a 30 minute presentation about one of your consultations once (or twice if time allows) during the semester, along with turning in a brief written report. \n\n| Week | Topic |\n| --- | --- |\n| 9/3 | [Statistical Consulting](question.html) |\n| 9/10 | Consult Walkthrough |\n| 9/17 | Guest Lecture: Eric Daza |\n| 9/24 | Guest Lecture: Manisha Desai |\n| 10/1 | Student Presentations |\n| 10/8 | Student Presentations |\n| 10/15 | Guest Lecture: Dave Miller |\n| 10/22 | Student Presentations |\n| 10/29 | Student Presentations |\n| 11/5 | Student Presentations |\n| 11/12 | Student Presentations |\n| 11/19 | Guest Lecture: Susan Gruber |\n| 11/26 | Student Presentations |\n| 12/3 | Student Presentations |\n| 12/10 | Student Presentations |\n\n## Consults\n\nDuring your consulting time(s), you and one other student will sit in a room and take consults from clients. Clients may either schedule in advance or drop-in and it’s up to you how to manage that time. Clients will come with statistical questions related to their projects and it is your job to try and help them make progress by clarifying/formalizing their questions and finding appropriate resources for them. \n\nThe consults are meant to be open-ended. You are welcome to engage deeply (e.g. up to and including writing some R code or doing a simple proof) but it’s not your responsibility to do someone else’s project, especially if that means you are ignoring other clients. Moreover the service is not meant to be a tutoring service: you should turn away students who want help on their homework. However if you want to engage or continue a collaboration outside of consulting hours that is up to you!\n\nYour individual consulting times and locations will be scheduled in the first week of the course and we will do our best to schedule around existing commitments. \n\n# Grading\n\nGrading for the course is pass / not pass. If your presentation and consult report are done in good faith, you participate in lecture, and you show up for your consulting hours, you will pass. If you have any issues preventing you from attending or participating please let me know as soon as possible.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Logistics\n\n- PH 298:003, class # 31320\n- Tuesdays, 2-3 pm (plus your 2h/wk consultations)\n- BWW 1206\n- 1 unit, P/NP or S/NS\n\n# Goals\n\nThe goal of this course is to give biostatistics graduate students structured opportunities to work with domain researchers, hone consulting skills, and receive feedback.
