It is painful and can be dangerous because it blocks the intestines, so surgeons are called upon to intervene and relieve the blockage. The standard treatment (at the time of the research described here) was to use a “gas enema”, a simple procedure that injects air into the baby’s rectum. The procedure is usually successful, but not always, so the clinical investigators of this study were aiming to understand the extent to which a successful outcome could be predicted using characteristics of the child or their clinical presentation. \n\n- What kind of question is this?\n- would it be appropriate to fit a regression model using backwards selection and then claim that prediction is possible if all the coefficients for the remaining variables are statistically significant?\n\n## Exercise {data-background-color=teal}\n\nReserachers have data derived from a cohort study of all children born in 1961 who were attending school in Tasmania in 1968 (aged 7 years), with this paper reporting a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from the parents at the time of recruitment (n = 8585). Questionnaires were used to determine both the primary\noutcome of interest (history of asthma in the child) and the risk factors, including child’s sex,\nother atopic conditions (such as hay fever and eczema), family history of allergic disease and\nparental smoking. The stated aim was to examine the strength of association of these risk factors with childhood asthma.\n\n- What kind of question is this?\n- would it be appropriate to fit a multivariate logistic regression and give the interpretation: *\"These atopic conditions[history of various other allergic conditions] were found to be independent risk factors, in that an increased risk of asthma was associated with each factor even though the increased risks associated with all other factors had been taken into consideration by the statistical model\"*?\n\n## Exercise {data-background-color=teal}\n\nYoung children who acquire a urinary tract infection may also develop an infection of the kidney known as pyelonephritis. Affected kidneys become enlarged during these infections, which makes it difficult to use ultrasonic measurements of kidney size as a reliable baseline for future assessment of growth. The research described here sought to estimate how much affected kidneys were enlarged, compared to normal kidneys.\n\n- What kind of question is this?\n- would it be appropriate to fit a regression model to estimating the difference in means between infected and\nuninfected kidneys at any age, with “adjustment for age” accomplished by including a smooth function of age as a covariate in the model?\n\n## Tips\n\n- understand the decision that someone would make based on this information\n- formalize the source of randomness and establish a target parameter \n    - understand how the question would be answered in an ideal setting with infinite data and control, etc.\n\n\n## A question {data-background-color=teal}\n\n- **How would you address this?**\n\n*I'm trying to make a predictive model to help me diagnose a disease in an African population.
